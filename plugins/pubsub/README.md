Clone the GitHub repo and run:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, to install remotely from GitHub run:

need to be installed into the same environment for Alerta to dynamically
discover them.

Add `pubsub` to the list of enabled `PLUGINS` in `alertad.conf` server
configuration file and set plugin-specific variables either in the
server configuration file or as environment variables.

```python
PLUGINS = ['pubsub']
```
